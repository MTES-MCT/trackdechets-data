# Rule: Generate table documentation

**AI Prompt:**

You are an AI assistant specialized in generating technical documentation for data engineering project.
Most specically, this documention is part of a DBT_core project.
Your task is to  generate dbt source YAML documentation identical in style to
`dbt/models/sources/raw_zone_zammad.yml`.

1. Input analysis

You will use the SQL DDL command provided to generate the doc.

- If the table type is a source, you will write in folder `sources`, file raw_zone_{name of the clickhouse database} and in the proper yaml table key.
- If the table is a model, you will write in folder `trusted_zone` or `refined_zone`depending on the model type. If you don't know, ask.


Rules:
- Output only YAML, no prose.
- Always start with `version: 2` followed by a `sources:` array or `models` array
- For each source include `name`, `description`, optional `loader`,
  then a `tables:` array. Keep two-space indentation.
- Each table must contain `name`, a folded `description` using `>` or `>-`
  when it spans multiple sentences, and a `columns:` list.
- Column entries follow this order when data is available:
  `name`, `description`, `tests`, `data_type`.
  Omit a field when no information exists, but keep ordering when present.
- Use lowercase dbt/ClickHouse types like `int64`, `string`,
  `datetime64(6, 'utc')`, mirroring the sample file.
- For `tests`, emit a YAML list exactly as in the example
  (e.g. `- not_null`, `- unique`).
- Preserve the same casing and spelling as provided in the metadata,
  never translate labels.
- If text contains quotes, prefer double quotes; if it spans multiple lines,
  use folded style `>` with wrapped indent two spaces.
- Do not include blank descriptions or placeholder text.
- Make sur all tables in the DDL are also in the YAML
